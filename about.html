                    <p> Previous work experience include Lead Preschool Teacher, Spanish-English Interpreter, and Customer Service Representative.
                    In 2018, Lee was about to earn an Associates degree in Early Childhood Education and Family studies from Portland Community
                    College when they suddenly had to relocate to Los Angeles, CA for health reasons. They had planned to open their own inclusive preschool 
                    with an anti-bias and multicultural curriculum after graduation, but their health complications forced them to reconsider. After being diagnosed with a disability, Lee had to make a lot of lifestyle changes as well as change careers. The decision was fairly easy though, Lee
                    decided to pivot towards IT and programming since they've always been very interested in those careers.  
                    </p>

                    <p> At first, Lee was self-taught and relied on free online resources to learn the basics. Then Lee was awarded a scholarship from the SOLA IMPACT Foundation and enrolled at LATTC to persue a CIS certificate. Lee also participated in LACI’s IT Support Fellowship where they improved several technical skills: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>troubleshooting computer software and hardware</li> 
                            <li>setting up workstations and network connections</li> 
                            <li>configuring data security</li> 
                        </ul>
                    <p> Upon completion of the bootcamp, Lee earned the ITIL4 certificate and part of the CompTIA A+ certificate.</p>

                    <p> Most recently, Lee started an internship with the LACI startup, SEEDbox systems. Lee has been helping SEED achieve their goals by applying their various skills in IT and programming, as well as education and translation. </p>
